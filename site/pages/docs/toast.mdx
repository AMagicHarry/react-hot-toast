# `toast()` API

Call it to create a toast from anywhere, even outside React. Make sure you add the `<Toaster/>` component to your app first.

### Blank

```
toast('Hello World');
```

The most basic variant. It does not have an icon by default, but you can provide one via the options.

### Success

```js
toast.success('Successfully created!');
```

Creates a notification with an animated checkmark. It can be themed with `iconTheme`.

### Error

```js
toast.error('This is an error!');
```

Creates a notification with an animated error icon. It can be themed with `iconTheme`.

### Loading

```js
toast.loading('Waiting...');
```

This will create a loading notification. Most likely you want to update it manually afterwards. For a friendly alternative, check out `toast.promise()`, which takes care of that automatically.

### Promise

This shorthand is useful for mapping a promise to a toast. It will update automtically when the promise resolves or fails.

#### Simple Usage

```js
const myPromise = fetchData();

toast.promise(myPromise, {
  loading: 'Loading',
  success: 'Got the data',
  error: 'Error when fetching',
});
```

It's recommend to add min-width to your `toast.promise()` calls to **prevent jumps** from different message lengths.

#### Advanced

You can provide a function to the success/error messages to incorporate the result/error of the promise. The third argument are `toastOptions` similiar to [`<Toaster />`](/docs/toaster)

```js
toast.promise(
  myPromise,
  {
    loading: 'Loading',
    success: (data) => `Successfully saved ${data.name}`,
    error: (err) => `This just happened: ${err.toString()}`,
  },
  {
    style: {
      minWidth: '250px',
    },
    success: {
      duration: 5000,
      icon: 'üî•',
    },
  }
);
```

## Available options

You can provide `ToastOptions` as second argument. They will overwrite all options received from `<Toaster/>`.

```js
toast('Hello World', {
  duration: 4000,

  // Styling
  style: {},
  className: '',

  // Custom Icon
  icon: 'üëè',

  // Change colors of success/error/loading icon
  iconTheme: {
    primary: '#000',
    secondary: '#fff',
  },

  // Aria
  role: 'status',
  ariaLive: 'polite',
});
```

## Default durations

Every type has their own duration. You can overwrite them `duration` with the toast options. This can be done per toast options or globally by the [`<Toaster/>`](/docs/toaster).

| type      | duration |
| --------- | -------- |
| `blank`   | 4000     |
| `error`   | 4000     |
| `success` | 2000     |
| `loading` | 30000    |

### Dismiss toast programmatically

You can manually dismiss a notification with `toast.dismiss`. Be aware that it triggers the exit animation and does not remove the Toast instantly. Toasts will auto-remove after 1 second by default.

#### Dismiss a single toast

```js
const toastId = toast.loading('Loading...');

// ...

toast.dismiss(toastId);
```

You can dismiss all toasts at once, by leaving out the `toastId`.

#### Dismiss all toasts at one

```
toast.dismiss()
```

To remove toasts instantly without any animations, use `toast.remove`.

#### Remove toasts instanstly

```
toast.remove(toastId)

// or

toast.remove()
```

### Update an existing toast

```js
const toastId = toast.loading('Loading...');

// ...

toast.success('This worked', {
  id: toastId,
});
```

### Render JSX custom content

You can provide a React components instead of text.

```jsx
toast(
  <span>
    Custom and <b>bold</b>
  </span>,
  {
    icon: <Icon />,
  }
);
```

You can also supply a function that receives the `Toast` as argument. This can be usefull to add a custom dismiss button.

```jsx
toast(
  (t) => (
    <span>
      Custom and <b>bold</b>
      <button onClick={() => toast.dismiss(t.id)}>Dismiss</button>
    </span>
  ),
  {
    icon: <Icon />,
  }
);
```

export default ({ children, meta }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
